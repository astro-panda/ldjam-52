# Poo Farmer

## Story

It is the **Time Now**, a non-negative, non-zero year about 63 years after the collapse of the global industrial economy, the **Time Before**. Nation states have dissolved into smaller, more local and feudal counties. Although remnants of the technological advancements from the **Time Before** are still present, and in some cases still part of everyday life, most are left to ruin due to the inability to organize broader community support their maintenance at scale.

Of all the resources that failed humanity, one has remained steadfast, **Poo** ðŸ’©.

Though virtually untapped during the **Time Before**, **Poo** is exceptionally versatile, available, and renewable. It is used for energy, heat, tools, and even currency. 

As global reliance on **Poo** increased and the use of digital and industrial tooling decreased, reports of sightings of strange creatures began circulating. Reports of goblins, trolls, fairies, and gnomes! All things thought to have only been in storybooks and songs, now walking the planet.

It appears that these creatures had been around, but were missed because of the technological distraction which plauged humanity in the **Time Before**. Ever present, but easily missed they were able to live off of humanity's preoccupation. Humanity is no longer distracted. The creatures' resources have now also shifted to **Poo**.

Everything wants it, everything needs it. 

Everything must have **Poo**ðŸ’©.

## Your Place in the **Time Now**

Like your father and his father before him, you are a farmer. Now with your parents gone, you've inherited the family business, and your business is **Poo**.

It's up to you to not run it into the ground, keep yourself fed, safe, and warmed with your Poo powered generator. All while making a profit enough to improve your conditions.

Your Poo farm is deep in the forest and surrounded by goblin villages. You have to stock up Poo before winter and the goblins know that. During the Poo Harvest, goblins pour out of the woods into your farm clearing to steal every turd they can get their hands on.

By any means necessary, ðŸ›‘STOP. THEM.ðŸ›‘
